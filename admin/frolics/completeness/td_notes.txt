Was going to send this to Larry Scheurich, but query started working.

Conceptually I have 3 basic tables:
  enrollment: 1 rec per enrollment period w/start/stop dates
    mrn
    enr_start
    enr_end
    incomplete_outpt_rx (takes values 'K', 'N', 'M')

  reporting_months: 1 rec per month of interest
    first_day (of the month)
    last_day (of the month)

  rx_fills: 1 rec per pharmacy fill
    mrn
    rxdate

My goal is to calculate, for each month in reporting_month:
  the number of people enrolled in that month
  the number of prescriptions enrollees filled in that month
  by values of incomplete_outpt_rx

My query is:

select reporting_months.first_day
    , enrollment.incomplete_outpt_rx
    , count(distinct enrollment.mrn) as n_enrolled
    , sum(case when rx_fills.mrn is null then 0 else 1 end) as num_fills
from  pardre1.inflate_months  as reporting_months LEFT JOIN
      pardre1.unholy_union    as enrollment
on    e.enr_start  le i.last_day AND
      e.enr_end    ge i.first_day LEFT JOIN
      sb_ghri.rx              as rx_fills
on    e.mrn = r.mrn AND
      r.rxdate between i.first_day and i.last_day
group by 1, 2
order by 1, 2


create table pardre1.outpt_ute_rates as
(select reporting_months.first_day
    , enrollment.incomplete_outpt_enc
    , ute.enctype as extra
    , count(distinct enrollment.mrn) as n_enrolled
    , sum(case when ute.mrn is null then 0 else 1 end) as num_events
from  pardre1.inflate_months  as reporting_months LEFT JOIN
      pardre1.unholy_union    as enrollment
on    enrollment.enr_start  le reporting_months.last_day AND
      enrollment.enr_end    ge reporting_months.first_day LEFT JOIN
      sb_ghri.utilization   as ute
on    enrollment.mrn = ute.mrn AND
      ute.adate between reporting_months.first_day and reporting_months.last_day
group by 1, 2, 3
--order by 1, 2, 3
) with data ;


There is a problem w/the logic
