how to arrange a git repo for version-controlling and distributing HCSRN qa code.

considerations
  at runtime we want /to_go and /to_stay subfolders, which get filled w/output/dsets, but we don't want those to be part of the repo (right?).  Can I engineer .gitignore so that the folders get created but everything in them is ignored?
    prob more trouble than it'd be worth to try and create those subdirs in SAS code...

  I want to keep my collation/report generation code in this repo as well, but I don't want it to be in the way or confusing to end-users who are cloning to get the latest code

  is there some easy way to factor out the environment setting stuff?  Would that be too confusing?
    gitignore env.sas
    include sample_env.sas in repo, which contains the edit section
    instruct end-users to rename sample_env.sas to env.sas
